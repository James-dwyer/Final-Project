CS 30 Final Pong Project

<h1><b>Pong Game using Class Design</b></h1>
<p>The Pong Program uses inheritance and intentional class design to create a Pong Game with Arraylists, key listeners, final classes ect.</P>
<br></br>
<h2><u>Interest in the Program</u></h2>
<p>I chose to do this project on Pong because I have worked with Pong for majority of the course and I think I am comfortable with Pong and how to make the game work</p>
